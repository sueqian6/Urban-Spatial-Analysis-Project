# Urban-Spatial-Analysis-Project
this is my notebook for project 2
in this project we were asked to do spatial analysis on new york city's night time activities. the notebook is written using IBM cclab. I have saved the outputs(interactive maps) in this repository as they are too large to be shown in the ipynb file
